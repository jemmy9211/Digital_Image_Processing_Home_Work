# Digital Image Processing Homework Submission

I am pleased to submit my Digital Image Processing homework, a requirement for the course offered by the Electrical Engineering Department at National Chung Hsing University (NCHU). This course focuses on utilizing digital signal processing techniques to manipulate images and achieve specific outcomes. My submission reflects a dedicated effort to comprehend and apply these concepts to practical scenarios.

## Course Overview

The NCHU EE Digital Image Processing course delves into the intricate realm of employing digital signals to process images. By exploring various methodologies and algorithms, students gain insights into transforming raw image data into meaningful and visually enhanced results.

## Term Project Readme

For the term project, I drew inspiration from the work of Tania Pouli and Erik Reinhard [1], specifically their research on progressive color transfer for images with arbitrary dynamic range. Additionally, I incorporated insights from Safithtechi's Emo_Filters repository [2] (https://github.com/safithetechi/Emo_Filters.git) to enhance the project's capabilities.
